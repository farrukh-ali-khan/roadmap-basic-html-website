# roadmap-basic-html-website
This project involves creating a basic HTML-only website with multiple pages, focusing on structuring content using semantic HTML. Key components include headers, footers, navigation bars, and main content areas. The goal is to build a well-structured site without CSS, which will be addressed in later projects.
